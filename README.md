# DiscordCustomRichPresence
DiscordCustomRichPresence with buttons and app &amp; browser tab listener

in my program you will find 3 pages custom, Apps and BrowserServices

Custom page:
Step1. To create your own game status you must first go to
https://discord.com/developers/applications and create an application.

Step2. 
Now enter the name of the game and it will be displayed on discord.

Step3. to add your own image go to the tab "Rich Presence" at the bottom of Art Assets you should see add images there you upload your image it must be at least 512x512 pixel in size as soon as your image is uploaded it can take up to 15 minutes until discord has initialized the image you can test this by reloading the page and see if it is already displayed there it has been taken over you enter the name of the image in the program at app icon

You can also add a button with a url click function if you click on the button yourself then in discord nothing happens why this is so I can not really explain exactly but as soon as someone of your friends clicks on it he comes to the url that you have entered.

Apps page
here you can activate a service that listens if one of the apps you selected is running and displays it on discord

Page Browser Service
if you have activated the service and e.g. listen to music on soundcloud or watch a youtube video, the program tracks this and displays it on discord.
